title: Climate Change Challenges
---
One of the critical factors for a successful hackathon project that gets real-world results is to pitch well-defined problem statements for teams to respond to. Successful, sustainable projects are created when organisations bring forwards key challenges and problem statements, collaborate with teams over the 48-hour event and show an ongoing commitment to creating real-world impact with these projects. We have engaged with various Challenge Partners that address the 15 global challenges of this hackathon. Examples of challenges are:

#### Help UK Schools Run on Sun
In the UK alone, there are over 6 million roofs that could feasibly support solar technology. Yet renewable energy is currently generating only 1/5 of the UK’s electricity. The organisation Friends of the Earth believes that starting with 30,000 UK schools, of which only 3% currently run solar energy is the best way to build a mass transition to the renewables we need.

A survey of UK schools and research found that often schools:
1. Do not know about this chance to save money, we estimate up to £8000 per year.
2. Are not sure how to get solar panels
3. They cannot afford the high upfront costs..
