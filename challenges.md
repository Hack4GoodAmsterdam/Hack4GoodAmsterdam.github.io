title: Climate Change Challenges
---
One of the critical factors for a successful hackathon project that gets real-world results is to pitch well-defined problem statements for teams to respond to. Successful, sustainable projects are created when organisations bring forwards key challenges and problem statements, collaborate with teams over the 48-hour event and show an ongoing commitment to creating real-world impact with these projects. We have engaged with various Challenge Partners that address the 15 global challenges of this hackathon. Examples of challenges are:

- [**Conservation Drones:** Crowdsourcing for Monitoring Palm Oil Expansion](https://geekli.st/hackathon/hack4good-06/idea/5406c792f715e79509aed63f)
- [**Friends of the Earth:** Help UK Schools Run on Sun](https://geekli.st/hackathon/hack4good-06/idea/53fc72d3a85e9ec10739d867)
- [**WeForest:** Reforestation for small-scale farmers in Zambia: tackling monitoring solutions](https://geekli.st/hackathon/hack4good-06/idea/53fb10d049710ef506a8440e)
